Python reimports the class from its module internally, creates an instance with its stored attributes, and sets the instance’s __class__ link to point to its original class. This way, loaded instances automatically obtain all their original methods (like lastName, giveRaise, and __repr__), even if we have not imported the instance’s class into our scope.\n",

    "    The classes in this chapter could be used as boilerplate “template” code to implement a variety of types of databases. Essentially, you can repurpose them by modifying the constructors to record different attributes and providing whatever methods are appropriate for the target application. For instance, you might use attributes such as name, address, birthday, phone, email, and so on for a contacts database, and methods appropriate for this purpose. A method named sendmail, for example, might use Python’s standard library smptlib module to send an email to one of the contacts automatically when called (see Python’s manuals or application-level books for more details on such tools). The AttrDisplay tool we wrote here could be used verbatim to print your objects, because it is intentionally generic.
